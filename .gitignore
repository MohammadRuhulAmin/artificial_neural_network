Gitignore# Byte-compiled files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environments
env/
venv/
ENV/
.venv/
.ENV/

# Distribution / Packaging

*.egg-info/
*.egg

# Logs and debug files

*.pyo

# Unit test / Coverage reports
htmlcov/
.tox/
.nox/
.coverage
*.cover
*.py,cover

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints

# IDEs and editors
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*.sublime-workspace
*.sublime-project

# System files

This template can be customized based on your specific project needs. It ensures that only the essential files are tracked in your repository, keeping it clean and efficient.
